# Emotion Detection in Facial Images using Machine Learning
This project is a Python notebook that uses machine learning models to detect emotions in facial images. The dataset used in this project consists of images of faces that have been labeled with one of several emotions.

## Prerequisites
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Download the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deadskull7/fer2013

## Getting Started
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/danmao1/FaceEmotion_Detector_ML.git

Navigate to the project directory:
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
Open the ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview
This notebook covers the following steps in the process of building a machine learning model for emotion detection in facial images:

Loading and exploring the dataset
Preprocessing the data
Building and evaluating different machine learning models
Selecting the best performing model and making predictions
The different machine learning models used in this project include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Conclusion
By following the steps in this notebook, you should be able to build a machine learning model for emotion detection in facial images and gain a better understanding of the various algorithms and techniques used in the field of machine learning. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please refer to the issues section of the repository for assistance.
